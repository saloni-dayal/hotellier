      "para": " Mahabalipuram (or Mamallapuram), located along southeastern Indias Coromandel Coast, was a celebrated port city of the Pallavas. The group of monuments there consists of rock-cut cave temples, monolithic temples, bas-relief sculptures, and structural temples as well as the excavated remains of temples. The Pallava dynasty, which ruled this area between 6th and 9th centuries CE, created these majestic edifices. The Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram occupies a distinct position in classical Indian architecture. These majestic edifices mark the high quality of craftsmanship in the region during 6th century CE. The natural landscape was utilized in carving out these structures, thereby making the ability of the Pallava craftsmen universally known. The monuments may be subdivided into five categories:The mandapas (rock-cut caves): During the time of Narasimhavarman-I Mamalla, new innovations were introduced in the rock medium in the form of cave temples. Notable examples of the cave temple are Konerimandapa, Mahishmardhini cave, and Varahamandapa. These rock-cut caves are richly embellished with sculptural representations known for their natural grace and suppleness. Noteworthy among them are Mahishamardhini, Bhuvaraha, Gajalakshmi, Tirivikrama, and Durga.",

      "para": " Ooty in the Southern Indian State of Karnataka is fondly called the 'Queen of hill stations'. Named among the most beautiful places in India, Ooty is set picturesquely in the Nilgiris, called the 'Blue Mountains' of India. Situated at an altitude of 2,240 meters above sea level, Ooty enjoys pleasant weather year-long. Formerly it used to be popular summer getaway during the British Raj and now too is one of the most preferred holiday destinations in the South. Drawing visitors from far ends of the globe, Ooty tours are perfect for families, honeymoon couples, nature lovers, etc.The major lure of Ooty is its beauty. Mists descend and settle on the hill-tops; lush tea gardens and coffee plantations are spread on the slopes, lakes dot the landscape and there are many more delights. The star attraction of a holiday in Ooty is the mountain train ride, also called the toy train. The Nilgiri Mountain Railways is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The rail route commences from Kallar, near Mettupalayam travelling through the many hair-raising curves and fearful tunnels. The train slowly chugs beside deep ravines full of verdant vegetation, gurgling streams and tea gardens. The ride is life-changing as you enjoy not just breath-taking beauty but also the splendid engineering that made such a thrilling ride possible in the early 20 th century.",
